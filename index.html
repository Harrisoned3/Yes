<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Waking up
When waking up and realizing you need to go to school you wake up in panic to see what the time is,if you are late you rush to get everything ready as fast as you can,if you have a good amount of time to get ready you take your time in many cases for people.
<br>
2.Going on The bus, when you go to your bus stop you usually wait for like an extra 10 minutes because the bus is late.After you get on the bus and sit down, with tons of people being near you,you have time to make friends or you already sat with your friends,if you sat with strangers most likely they are so annoying that you never want to see them agian but with friends you can sit down and enjoy your time.
<br>
3.Then your at the school if your 2nd grade or under you go through the main entrance if your 3rd grade and higher you go through the other section thats closer to your class,then you go to your class and you see everyone in your class ready to learn!
